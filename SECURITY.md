SECURITY NOTES
- This demo uses a voice *phrase* (speech-to-text) for illustrative purposes only. It is NOT a secure biometric.
- In production, use a proper speaker verification system and TLS everywhere.
- Keep JWT secrets in environment variables and do not commit them.
- Add rate-limiting, monitoring, and replay-attack protections.
